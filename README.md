# GTK+ Sony BRAVIA Remote

A simple GTK+ application to control Sony BRAVIA Smart TV. I'm developing this app for my dad who's having constant issues with his existing software remote.

This is also my very first GTK+/C project! :)

(Since this is aimed at one specific person who is using one specific TV, most of the values are hard-coded. If you find my work useful, don't forget to change those values!)
